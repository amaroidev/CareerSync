## Strategic Considerations & Development Guidelines

### Technical & Architectural Foundation

*The "invisible" infrastructure that enables everything else*

### API-First Architecture

- **Core Principle**: Design the platform as a comprehensive set of APIs from day one
- **Data Aggregation Strategy**: Build robust scrapers/connectors for major job boards with fallback to official API partnerships
- **Third-Party Integration Ready**: Enable universities to plug scholarship databases directly into the system
- **Future-Proofing**: Allow learning platforms (Coursera, edX) and other services to integrate seamlessly

### Data Normalization Engine

- **Universal Taxonomy**: Create standardized classifications for job titles, skills, academic fields, and requirements
- **Smart Matching Logic**: "Software Engineer" = "Developer" = "Coder" = "Software Developer" in matching algorithms
- **Academic Field Mapping**: "STEM majors" automatically includes Computer Science, Engineering, Mathematics, etc.
- **Location Intelligence**: Handle various location formats (city, state, country, remote, hybrid)

### Scalable Infrastructure Requirements

- **Secure Document Storage**: AWS S3 with strict IAM policies and encryption at rest
- **Queue-Based Processing**: Handle OCR transcript processing and AI analysis asynchronously
- **Database Design**: Optimized for complex queries across multiple data types (users, opportunities, applications)
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis for frequently accessed data like search results and user recommendations

---

## AI Development Rules & Guidelines

### Core AI Principles

1. **Transparency First**: Always explain why recommendations were made
2. **Bias Mitigation**: Regularly audit algorithms for discrimination against protected classes
3. **User Control**: Allow users to adjust AI preferences and opt-out of automated suggestions
4. **Continuous Learning**: Implement feedback loops to improve matching accuracy over time

### Matching Algorithm Requirements

- **Fairness Constraints**: Ensure equal opportunity recommendations regardless of university prestige, gender, or ethnicity
- **Explainable AI**: Provide clear reasoning for each recommendation ("Matched because: Python skills, 3.8 GPA, Computer Science major")
- **Dynamic Weighting**: Adjust importance of factors based on opportunity type (scholarships emphasize academics, jobs emphasize skills)

### Data Processing Standards

- **Privacy by Design**: Minimize data collection to what's necessary for functionality
- **Anonymization**: Strip personal identifiers from training data and analytics
- **User Consent**: Explicit opt-in for sharing data with employers or institutions
- **Right to Delete**: Complete data removal upon user request

### Quality Assurance

- **Human Oversight**: AI recommendations reviewed by human moderators for quality
- **A/B Testing**: Continuously test algorithm improvements against control groups
- **Success Metrics**: Track application-to-interview and application-to-offer ratios
- **Feedback Integration**: Use user ratings and outcomes to improve future recommendations

## AI Development Rules (for the Copilot-like assistant building Pathfinder)

To guide AI coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Cursor, Continue) while developing Pathfinder:

### 1. Code Quality & Standards

- Always generate clean, modular, and well-documented code.
- Follow SOLID principles and clean architecture.
- Prefer readability over clever shortcuts.

### 2. Security & Privacy by Default

- Never expose API keys, credentials, or secrets in code.
- Default to secure storage practices (e.g., environment variables, encryption).
- Ensure compliance with GDPR/CCPA when handling user data.

### 3. Scalability & Maintainability

- Use API-first design for jobs, scholarships, and user data.
- Design databases with normalization + indexing for performance.
- Write code that is testable (unit + integration tests generated alongside features).

### 4. Error Handling & Reliability

- Always include proper error handling, logging, and retries in generated code.
- Fail gracefully with useful error messages.
- Ensure no silent failures in critical flows (uploads, deadlines, notifications).

### 5. Ethics & Bias Avoidance

- When generating AI models (matching, recommendations):
    - Do not bias based on gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.Do not bias based on gender, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.
    - Use anonymized data for training.Use anonymized data for training.
    - Always allow user override of AI suggestions.Always allow user override of AI suggestions.

### 6. Explainability & Transparency

- Generate AI features that can explain their decisions (e.g., why an opportunity was recommended).
- Avoid opaque "black box" outputs.

### 7. Development Workflow Rules

- Use CI/CD pipelines for deployment (auto tests + linting).
- Ensure all AI-generated code passes linting and test coverage before merging.
- Document every AI-generated function with docstrings and comments.

### 8. Responsibility Boundaries

- AI assistants suggest draft code, docs, or tests → human developers must review, refine, and approve.
- Never auto-deploy AI-generated code without human verification.
